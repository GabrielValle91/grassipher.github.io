For the longest time I had no interest in coding, I saw it as something I would never be able to fully grasp... I think this was mostly due to a poor experience with a highschool programming class I took and how the teacher approached teaching and treated the students poorly....But this all changed about 10 years later.

In May 2017, I had been working at my first corporate job for about 11 months, the department I was in handled warehousing and local and intrastate transportation. The transportation team of the department didn't have a good way to keep track of neccessary information, they were relying on google sheets to keep track of shipment information, vehicle information and billing information. There were many problems with this, ranging from speed of the google sheet as more information was entered, to keeping track of who was entering bad information into the google sheet. It was at this point I decided to implement a solution that would fix nearly all the problems we were facing.

After doing some research on possible solutions, I settled on setting up a MS Access database and user front end. At the time, management did not know I was working on this solution so I did not have access to the company's financial backing to set up a more robust system and I knew it would be faster to go with a simpler solution, and we needed something as soon as possible. Two long weeks later, I had setup the basis for our new dispatching system. It handled all the billing needs, even calculating charges based on the tariffs we had with our customers, it allowed shipments to be assigned to drivers so I was easy to track who was doing what on a daily or weekly basis, and it allowed vehicles and equipment to be assigned to shipments so we could figure out what equipment was not being used so we could potentially reduce costs by eliminating that piece of equipment.

Since the initial release of the system, I have continued to expand on it, adding more features the team requests and expanding on current features as my knowledge continued to grow. A year later and that department continues to use the software I created, and since then programming has encompassed my every thought.
