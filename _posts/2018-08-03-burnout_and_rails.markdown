Up and through my Sinatra project I was flying through the program, completing on average 10-12% of the program every week while working at my job 50+ hours a week... essentially all my "free time" was dedicated to the program, mostly because I love learning and I love programming. After roughly 6 weeks of this schedule is when things took a turn for worse... it was unreasonable to expect to keep this work and school schedule for such a prolonged experience and I started to experience burnout when I started the Rails section.

I tried to power through it for a couple days, but I just found myself unable to focus on the course material and did not feel like I was fully grasping the materials covered; I knew I was in trouble. It did not help that this also started the day before my birthday, I am not a fan of celebrating my birthday, I had just bought a new macbook pro and it was starting to feel like my girlfriend was getting fed up with me spending my free time on this course instead of with her; I felt like my life was starting to spin out of control.

I knew I needed to take a step back from everything and sort out my priorities, I was not going to let things get completely out of hand. I decided to take a small break from the program realizing that I was not in a race to complete things and that I wanted to truly learn the material, not just have a course completion under my belt. For a few days I only did 1 or 2 lessons and made sure to spend time with friends and family, which is exactly what I needed, I was rejuvenating.

I eventually made my way to the Rails project and I knew I was ready to hit the ground running again. I decided to make a very basic version of software I have built for my current company using MS Access and VBA. I say basic, but that is mostly because I feel I have not yet been taught how to incorporate the interactivity you find on some websites (changing a select element's value changes information on the screen, drag on drop to change data, etc), so basic is probably not the right word... I decided to create the foundation for a web app that might be used by my current company in the future.
