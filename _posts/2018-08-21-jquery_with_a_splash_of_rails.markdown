About midway through the Rails section of the curriculum, I realized that we would not be covering an aspect of website creation until a later date; an aspect that is really more than just an aspect, it is really a core part of a user's experience with websites in today's environment. Upon this realization, I greatly looked forward to the Javascript and Rails section since I felt that is when my understanding of web application creation would greatly expand...

Before getting to the Javascript section of the program I read it was the section that really threw some people through a loop due to its differences from Ruby, but never one to shy from a challenged I charged on head first after finishing up my Rails project. People were not kidding when they said Javascript felt very different than Ruby. At first it felt like the bastard child of Ruby and VBA, but the more I practiced with the language, the more intuitive it felt... at least until I arrived at templates. I struggled, and still struggle, with templates, so much so that I prefer to manually write out the Javascript to create the layout instead of creating a template. JQuery, however, feels amazingly powerful even though I know there are still better options out there; I feel unstoppable with JQuery in my pocket, and yet I look forward to React/Redux.

While working on my JQuery and Rails project I did not really come across anything that stumped me, everything seemed to just flow well. That does not mean that everything worked the first time I tried it, it simply means I was able to identify errors that occurred and quickly fixed and learned from them. This felt like a huge break through, it was the first time I felt like I was starting to have a really solid grasp on everything; it felt like I had a good chance at becoming a succesfully developer.
