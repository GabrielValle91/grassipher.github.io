Before completing the Sinatra module I felt like I was just cruising through the web development curriculum, completing just over 50% of the program in about 5 weeks. Don't misunderstand, I was learning a lot, but it felt like I was learning just a new programming language and I was left wondering when I would get to material where I would learn to make an actual product. Thankfully this feeling changed when I arrived at the sinatra project.

Deciding on a doman for this project was not difficult; prior to starting at Flatiron, I had some programming experience with VBA and MS Access, creating a tms/wms combo for my current employer, so I decided to try my hand at creating a web application that had some of the functionality of a system I had created previously to see what was possible.

The start of the project went smoothly, for the most part. Due to one of the requirements for the project, a signup page being required, I had to scale back my project a little bit because I was not able to figure out how to implement the signup page in such a way that a new user would have to request request permission from an admin user to access specific clients.... essentially I realized that while this was a web application, it would not have the full functionality of a wms where a company would have inventory for many clients in the system and have the ability to give those clients access to only their inventory and transactions, but maybe that is something I will tackle with a future project.

Through the course of building the web application I learned what some of my weak points were by hitting temporary roadblocks, but I learned through trial and error and continued forward. Some of the roadblocks I hit were with CSS styling (I didn't realize the ordering of the attributes for an element would have different effects on the display) and also implementing a has many through relationship.

This project as a whole helped solidify many concepts I had been learning and also brought to light some things I need to focus on a little more. Everyday I love programming more and I continue to look forward to learning more as I progress through the program!
