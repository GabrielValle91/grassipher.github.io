It’s been a long three months since starting the Flatiron School online program, a long but very rewarding journey. 

When I first started the program I thought I had a good grasp on programming concepts since I had spent a better part of a year working on a software system for my employer; however, I was vastly unaware of the capabilities and fundamentals of languages other than VBA. My first milestone in the program was wrapping my head around Object Oriented Programming. This was a concept I had inadvertently been touching in VBA, but  I was not fully utilizing it or even knew what it was. Learning about OOP really opened up the doors, not only for Ruby and web development, but all other major programming languages and software development in general. 

After tackling OOP, there was a brief introduction to HyperText Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets. With the basics of HTML and CSS under my belt, things were kicked up a notch with web frameworks, including both Sinatra and Rails. Sinatra and Rails were eye openers to how easy and quick it is to build the foundation for a web application. Both frameworks handle a lot of the nitty gritty work, and Rails provides a lot of helpers that simplify the web developer’s job so the developer can focus on more complex aspects to the application. With Rails in the tool belt, the way was open for JavaScript.

JavaScript was the next step in the journey. JS is currently the most popular programming language, it’s versatility and functionality are likely contributing factors. JS was very different than Ruby, not necessarily conceptually, but certainly syntactically. After getting a handle on JS, a lot of new functionality is available, ie. querying a database for more information without refreshing the page, updating a database without refreshing the page, manipulating the DOM, loading new pages without refreshing the page, and much more. JS has been used to development frameworks for easier development and better user interaction, frameworks like React.

React and Redux really pushed things to the limit, but it also busted wide the door to endless possibilities. The combination of React and Redux is similar to OOP, where every aspect of a web application is a separate component that can interact not only with each other, but a unifying store that holds relevant information for the application. Functions, actions and components are heavily abstracted to make each component easily reusable for other aspects of the application. This helps keep the application DRY, while also providing users familiarity throughout the application. 

I learned much more than I thought I was going to in this program, but there is still so much to learn. I look forward to starting my career as a software developer and to continue my goal of life long learning.
